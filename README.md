# project
This project is devoted to research of applying ML-algorithms for embryo-classification task to define whether the definite case of emryo transfering will be succesful or not. 
Tuning file is the latest version of proving that classical ML-algorithms are able to work correctly with the data we currently have. We except to get more data in the near future to make submitted algorithms work better and implement more complicated models such as neural networks.
